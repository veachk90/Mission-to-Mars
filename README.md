# Mission-to-Mars

#### Overview
For this analysis, there were specific questions about Mars's environment that were asked, and it was my responsibility to find the answers from the data. 

#### How many months exist on Mars?
Mars has twelves months. From the data, the 'month' column indicates the Martian month. 

#### How many Martian days' worth of data are there?
The data consists of 1967 Martian days. This was found by simply finding the difference between the last day that the data were collected and the first. 

#### Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest?
On avereage, the third month has the lowest temperature, while the eighth month has the highest. This is readily apparent from the graph that sorts the mean minimum temperatures by month.

#### Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest?
The month with the lowest average monthly atmospheric pressure is the sixth month, while the ninth month has the highest.

#### How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year? A visual estimate within 25% was made.
By using the graph of average minimum temperatures, an estimate of the seasons on Mars can be determined. This is done by noting the critical points in the graph that mark the local minimums and maximums. That is, by considering the data from one peak temperature to the next, we have an idea of the span of one Martian year. Doing so shows that Mars has about 650 days per year.
